        <p>You can contact me at email@edmar.org</p>
        <p>Book me
If you think that I can be in any way helpful to you, aside from just emailing me, you can also book 20 minutes of my time, so that we could jump on a call and chat about whatever interests you the most.
(Due to time constraints I cannot promise anything more than 20 minutes)</p>
