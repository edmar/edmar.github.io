It’s been a long time since I stopped blogging. In the age of 30 second videos and 140 characters, writing long form seems like an old man's game. However, blogging has always had a special place in my heart because it has brought me many great things. The company I co-founded would probably not exist if not for a random comment I left on a stranger's blog. This post is my way of convincing myself that it is still worth having a personal blog in 2019.

Books are one of the most magical things in the world. Reading great books is like having access to the brightest minds not only of today, but of all time. I have been an avid reader since I was a child and it’s a vital part of my identity. From my love of reading, I grew a profound admiration for those who can write not only books but other mediums as well. 

I always avoided writing because I thought I didn’t have anything new to add to the great pool of human knowledge. Writing just to get an audience always seemed like a game that I didn’t want to be a part of. My thinking was these were my only alternatives: Write profound new things or write for views. Since I didn’t felt capable of writing anything great and writing for views didn’t interest me, I ended up not writing that much. 

Communicating great ideas and getting an audience are not the only reasons for writing. One of my favorite books of all time was not written to be read, it was a collection of reflections from a man trying to teach himself how to be a better person. Writing to yourself is a powerful way to clarify your ideas and a beautiful method for self expression. Maybe it’s possible that your own experience can touch another person as well and even if it’s only an individual, even if it’s only a possibility, it’s worth the effort.
